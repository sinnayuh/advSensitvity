# Advanced Sensitivity
A lightweight client-side Fabric mod that enhances Minecraft's mouse sensitivity controls, allowing for precise sensitivity adjustments beyond the vanilla GUI limitations.

## Features
- Set exact sensitivity values for perfect aim translation from other games
- Support for both decimal and percentage values
- No GUI clutter - everything through simple commands
- Compatible with LabyMod

## Usage
The mod adds a single, intuitive command:

```
/sens <value>
```

### Examples:
```
/sens 0.000923  # Set exact decimal sensitivity
/sens 50        # Set 50% sensitivity
/sens           # View current sensitivity
```

### Converting from other games?
This mod is perfect for players who want to match their sensitivity from other games exactly. For example, if you're coming from CS2 or Valorant and want to maintain your muscle memory, you can use precise decimal values like `0.000923` instead of being limited to Minecraft's percentage-based GUI.

## Why use this mod?
- **Precision**: Set sensitivity to exact values without being restricted to Minecraft's GUI slider
- **Convenience**: Quick command-based changes without opening settings
- **Compatibility**: Works with popular mod loaders and doesn't conflict with other mods
- **Performance**: Zero impact on game performance - it's as lightweight as it gets

## Note
All changes persist between game sessions and are saved in your Minecraft options file.
